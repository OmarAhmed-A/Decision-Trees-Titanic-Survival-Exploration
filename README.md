# Decision trees Lab using Scikit-learn and Pandas (Python)
This lab was a part of the [EgFwd-ML Cross Skilling](https://egfwd.com/specializtion/machine-learning/) course.

It is a simple example of using decision trees in scikit-learn and pandas.
Here we use decision trees to create a model that predicts whether a person who embarked on the titanic has survived or not.
